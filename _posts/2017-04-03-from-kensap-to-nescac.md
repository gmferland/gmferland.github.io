In college one of my work study jobs was to be the team correspondent for men's cross country. On the bus home from meets, when everyone else was doing schoolwork or sleeping off the pain of the morning's race, I was rushing to put together a recap to be posted on our athletic department website. I really enjoyed that job because it got me even more involved with the team when I was just a walk on who never contributed in races. But I also enjoyed writing about something that I was passionate about.

Midway through my first winter out of college, I realized I missed that writing very much. I was lucky enough to get in contact with TrackYack.com, a relatively new website that focused on the niche of NESCAC cross country and track. I brought to them a pitch for a story about KenSAP, the Kenyan Scholar-Athlete Project. At Williams I had been teammates with a KenSAP student and I was motivated by my curiosity about the program. Over the course of about two weeks, I was able to interview five students, a tutor, and the co-founder of KenSAP, and the result is my first published piece of journalism!
