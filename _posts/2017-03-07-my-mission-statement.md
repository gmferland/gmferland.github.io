My intention in creating this website is to share my interests, both personal and professional. I enjoy writing, so I wanted to start a blog with no other purpose than to talk about myself. My two favorite activites are running and skiing, so expect lots of content about those two sports. I also want to use this blog as a platform to express my knowledge of computer science and my knack for solving math puzzles. Maybe one day my website will take a clearer direction but for now I am content to keep it very open ended. I hope you like reading my posts as much as I like writing them!
