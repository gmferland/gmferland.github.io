<p>As a freshman at Williams, I decided to walk onto the cross country team because it was something I had done a little in high school and I wanted to try it out. Like many runners, I found myself frustrated by injuries, but I kept coming back because before getting hurt I always felt like I was on the edge of making a real breakthrough. I also made some of my best friends on the cross country team and I couldn't leave that behind.</p>

<p>Now about five years into my boom and bust cycle, I feel like I've finally figured out how to train within the limits of my own body. But my number one goal is still to stay healthy. I run because I enjoy competition and bettering myself. I run because going out for a few miles with a friend is a great way to catch up. And I run because it is a daily habit that I can center my life around.</p>

<p>If you'd like to learn more about my training and races, I keep public logs on <a href="http://www.running2win.com/community/public-log.asp?m=gmferland&k=Log">Running2Win</a> and <a href="https://www.strava.com/athletes/19596348">Strava</a>. I also write about running in my <a href="/categories/#running">blog</a>.</p>
