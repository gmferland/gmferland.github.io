<p>I grew up on the coast of Maine, just north of Portland, and attended Williams College in Western Massachusetts. I've always lived in small communities and enjoy making new friends and connections. I started running cross country my senior year of high school and now running is at the center of my life. But my first and foremost favorite activity is skiing and so I'm spending my first winter out of school as a ski bum in Alta, Utah.</p>

<p>I studied math at Williams and I hope one day to become a math teacher. My interest in math  puzzles and other problems that require clever and creative approaches led me to also take many computer science classes. As a student, I believe my ability to learn quickly is my greatest strength.</p>

<p>If you'd like to know more about my education and work experience, please take a look at my resume.</p>
