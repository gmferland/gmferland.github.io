<h2>
    I'm a software developer.
</h2>
<p>
    I specialize in full stack web development at <a href="http://www.nevo.com">Nevo Technologies</a>, but I'm always open to learning new things.
</p>
<h2>
    I'm a runner.
</h2>
<p>
    I run for fun, but I also compete with the number one goal of getting faster. Most of my workouts find their way to <a href="https://www.strava.com/athletes/19596348">Strava</a>.
</p>
<h2>
    I'm a skier.
</h2>
<p>
  I grew up skiing Sugarloaf and Sunday River. My heart will always be in New England, but after spending the 2016-2017 winter at Alta feel at home in the Wasatch.
