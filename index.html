    <h2>
      I'm a runner.
    </h2>
    <p>
      I run for fun, but I also compete with the number one goal of getting faster. Most of my workouts find their way to <a href="https://www.strava.com/athletes/19596348">Strava</a>.

    <h2>
      I'm a skier.
    </h2>
    <p>
      I grew up skiing Sugarloaf and Sunday River. My heart will always be in New England, but after spending a winter at Alta I feel at home in the Wasatch.
